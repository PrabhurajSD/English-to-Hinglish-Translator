Sample Input-Output:

1. Input: “Definitely share your feedback in the comment section.”
   Output: “ जरूर अपनी feedback comment section में share करें। ”

2. Input: “So even if it's a big video, I will clearly mention all the products”
   Output: “तो वैसे ही अगर यह एक बड़ा video है, मैं स्पष्ट रूप से सभी products का उल्लेख करूंगा।”

3. Input: “I was waiting for my bag.”
   Output: “ मैं अपने bag के लिए इंतज़ार कर रहा था।”



[NOTE: OpenAI's API only processes 3 requests per minute, so it may throw an error in case  the limit is exceeded. 
Also model may start to give accurate output after 2-3 turns (reasons are explained below)]


(The variability in the code's output for the same sentence can be attributed to the probabilistic nature of the language model and the inherent
diversity of possible translations. Below are some compelling reasons to explain why the code generates different answers for the same sentence every time:
1. Language Model Uncertainty: The code utilizes a sophisticated language model(OpenAI's GPT-3.5 Turbo)  which employs a probabilistic approach to generate responses. 
   It considers various possible translations based on the input sentence and available context. Consequently, multiple valid translations can emerge from the same input.
2. Diverse Language Context: The language model has been trained on an extensive dataset that includes diverse linguistic patterns, regional variations, and writing styles. 
   As a result, it may offer different interpretations of the same sentence to accommodate various Hinglish language conventions and user preferences.
3. Context Sensitivity: The code takes into account the context provided in the prompt and any implicit or explicit cues within the input sentence. Depending on the perceived context, 
   The model may generate alternative translations to better suit the context.)
