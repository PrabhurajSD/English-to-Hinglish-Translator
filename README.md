Steps to Run the Model:
  1) Obtain your OpenAI API key and store it securely.
  2) Create a file named "Secret_Key.py" and store your API key as follows:
     python code:
     openai_key = "your-api-key-here"
  3) copy the code of translator.py in any python compiler (e.g - Jupyter Notebook, pyCharm, etc)
  4) run the code

Evaluating Model Performance:

Evaluating the performance of a language translation model like the one using OpenAI's GPT-3.5 Turbo can be challenging 
since it's a pretrained model that generates responses based on a vast amount of data. However, you can assess its performance in the following ways:
1) Manually review the translated sentences. Ensure that the translation sounds natural, maintains the meaning, and retains the original sentence's tone.
2) Compare the model's translations with your own knowledge of both languages (English and Hindi). Note any inaccuracies or instances where the translation
   deviates from the intended meaning.
3) Assess the fluency and coherence of the Hinglish sentences. Ensure that the translation flows well and is easy to understand for bilingual speakers.
4) Check if the script differentiation (Hindi in Devanagari script and English in the English script) is correctly applied.
5) Gather feedback from users or stakeholders who are fluent in both languages to assess how well the translations meet their expectations.
